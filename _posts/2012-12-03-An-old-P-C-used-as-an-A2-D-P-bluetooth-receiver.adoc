= An old PC used as an A2DP bluetooth receiver

Works for me with Linux Mint 12.



The tutorials I found explain the part where we must add


----
Enable=Source
----

in `/etc/bluetooth/audio.conf`



but I had a hard time to figure out that I had to modify `/etc/pulse/default.pa` and add


----
load-module module-switch-on-connect

load-module module-loopback 
----


else the sink/source are not automatically connected.
