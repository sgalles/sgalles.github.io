= Linux and Logitech MX mouses resolution

Without its real driver, my Logitech MX 510 mouse is seen by Linux as a 400 cpi resolution mouse. Actually it can be used in 800 cpi thanks to link:http://www.bedroomlan.org/~alexios/coding_lmctl.html[lmctl]



I've added this script to the 'Startup Program' list of Gnome :



[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh
lmctl -8
xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 8 9 6 7"

----


The xmodmap call allows to properly configure the thumb buttons.
