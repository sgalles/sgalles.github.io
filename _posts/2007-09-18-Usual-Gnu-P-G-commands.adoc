= Usual GnuPG commands

I tend to forget these very usual GnGPG commands as I use them only once in while. Now I won't forget them, or at least I'll known how to quickly find them :



Sign a file :



[source,bash]
----
gpg --detach-sign --armor myfile.tar.gz

----


Encrypt and decrypt a file for my own use :



[source,bash]
----
gpg --encrypt --recipient 'MyName' foo.txt
gpg --output foo.txt --decrypt foo.txt.gpg

----


Encrypt a free text for someone :



[source,bash]
----
echo 'Hello world' | gpg --output encrypted_hello.txt --encrypt --armor -r myfriend@whatever.com

----


Get my own fingerprint :



[source,bash]
----
gpg  --fingerprint  myaddress@whatever.com

----
