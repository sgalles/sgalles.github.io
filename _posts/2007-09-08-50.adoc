= An other Nautilus script : create directory with date

I've link:http://userstories.blogspot.com/2007/09/nautilus-scripts.html[already described] how to add custom scripts for Gnome file manager, Nautilus. So here is a an other simple script : it allows to create a directory with the name prefixed by the current date, via the contextual menu (right click) of Nautilus in the window of an other directory.

Just type the name of the directory in the popup dialogue ; spaces will automatically replaced by underscores. 



You must install link:http://xdialog.dyns.net/[XDialog] to be able to use this script.

On Ubuntu :



[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install xdialog

----


And here is the script :



[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh

CURRENTDATE=`date +%y.%m.%d`
DIRNAME=`Xdialog --title "Directory with date creation" --inputbox "Date : $CURRENTDATE\nDirectory name ?" 8 45 2>&1`
case $? in
0) mkdir $CURRENTDATE.${DIRNAME// /_};;
1) exit;;
esac
