= An old PC used as an A2DP bluetooth receiver

Works for me with Linux Mint 12.



The tutorials I found explain the part where we must add



_Enable=Source_ 

in /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf



but I had a hard time to figure out that I had to modify /etc/pulse/default.pa and add

_load-module module-switch-on-connect_ 

_load-module module-loopback_ 



else the sink/source are not automatically connected.
