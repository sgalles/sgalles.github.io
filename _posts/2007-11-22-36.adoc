= Convert an image to high quality PDF, Redux

In a previous post I explained how to link:http://userstories.blogspot.com/2007/11/convert-image-to-pdf-with-gimp.html[Convert an image to PDF with Gimp], but the quality of the picture in the PDF turned out to be rather poor for printing purpose.



So here is an other way, install _tiff2pdf_ .

On Ubuntu for instance :



[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install libtiff-tools
----
Then save your image as a tiff image, then use _tiff2pdf_  to convert it to a PDF. For example, for an A4 sized PDF :



[source,bash]
----
tiff2pdf -p A4  -o foo.pdf foo.tiff
----


For a multiple pages PDF, preprocess your TIFF files with _tiffcp_ 



[source,bash]
----
tiffcp foo1.tiff foo2.tiff foo3.tiff totalfoo.tiff
----
