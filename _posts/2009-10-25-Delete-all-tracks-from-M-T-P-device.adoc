= Delete all tracks from MTP device

My MTP MP3 player does not allow to delete all albums with one command (yes I really wanted to delete all tracks ! )



Bash to the rescue :

mtp-tracks | grep 'Track ID' | awk '{print $3}' | xargs mtp-delfile -n



Of course you must install the mtp-tools, on Ubuntu :

sudo apt-get install mtp-tools
