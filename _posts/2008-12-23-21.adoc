= How to negate a regexp with a negative lookahead

When I need it, I tend to forget how to create a regular expression that matches a large set of strings but does not match some specific strings. It's tricky because it involves the negative lookahead syntax.



For exemple the regexp



*.+\.java*



matches any java filename.





But the following regexp



*(?!Foo\.java).+\.java*



matches any java filename except _Foo.java_  because the negative lookahead of _Foo\.java_  will prevent _.+\.java_  from matching.



The negative lookahead syntax is

*(?!X)* where X is the string that must not be matched.
