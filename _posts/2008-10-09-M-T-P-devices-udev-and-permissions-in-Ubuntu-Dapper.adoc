= MTP devices, udev and permissions in Ubuntu Dapper

I had to install Gnomad2 in Ubuntu Dapper in order to upload files to my MTP Mp3 player.



I followed this great link:http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=199250[How To]



However Gnomad2 could not open the device unless I was root (same thing for mtp-detect)



It looked like a permission problem in /dev/bus/usb



This worked for me :



In `/etc/udev/rules.d/40-permissions.rules` I changed


----
# USB devices (usbfs replacement)

SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device", MODE="0664"
----

to


----
# USB devices (usbfs replacement)

SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"
----


Then


----
sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart
----
